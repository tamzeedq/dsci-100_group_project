    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Heart diseases are conditions that affect the heart's structure and function. They can develop into a serious stage and threaten someoneâ€™s life, so it is very important to make an early diagnosis and apply treatment as soon as possible. Heart diseases come in many different forms: coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disorders, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, pericardium, and heart failure. In our research, we will be analyzing coronary angiography disease which is the narrowing of blood vessels and constriction of proper blood flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "Can we use classification to classify the presence and severity of angiographic disease in a patient based on their age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, and chest pain?    \n",
    "\n",
    "### DataSet \n",
    "The dataset is collected by researchers in hospitals from Cleveland, Hungary, Long Beach California, and Switzerland. The dataset can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease. The dataset orignally contained 76 attributes but researchers have reduced it to 14 attributes. Them being,\n",
