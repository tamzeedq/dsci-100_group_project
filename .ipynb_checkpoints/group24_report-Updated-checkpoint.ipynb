    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Heart diseases are conditions that affect the heart's structure and function. They can develop into a serious stage and threaten someone’s life, so it is very important to make an early diagnosis and apply treatment as soon as possible. Heart diseases come in many different forms: coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disorders, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, pericardium, and heart failure. In our research, we will be analyzing coronary angiography disease which is the narrowing of blood vessels and constriction of proper blood flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "Can we use classification to classify the presence and severity of angiographic disease in a patient based on their age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, and chest pain?    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset \n",
    "The dataset is collected by researchers in hospitals from Cleveland, Hungary, Long Beach California, and Switzerland. The dataset can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease. The dataset orignally contained 76 attributes but researchers have reduced it to 14 attributes. Them being,\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct our data analysis by building a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model to predict for the presence of heart disease. We will use the variables Age, Sex, Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg), Cholesterol (mg/dl), Max Heart Rate, and Type of Chest Pain as our predictors and predict for the presence of heart disease in a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning for predictor variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age:** We chose age to be a predictor as many studies show that increasing age is a risk factor for heart disease. People of older age, around 65 and older are more likely to develop coronary heart disease. This is because aging can cause changes in the heart and blood vessels. Many changes to the heart happen with an increase in age, for example, buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries and increased stiffness of the arteries. Furthermore, over time  the heart muscle inevitably weakens making it more at risk to suffer from heart disease. Overall, it is evident that increasing age leads to an increased chance of developing heart disease which is why we are using age as a predictor for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chest Pain:** We are using chest pain as a predictor as it is a common symptom many doctors use to identify patients that may possibly have coronary heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High blood pressure:** We are using blood pressure as a predictor as several medical studies show how having high blood pressure is one of greatest risk factors for heart disease. According to the United States National Library of medicine, “High Blood Pressure is an important risk factor for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart valve diseases, aortic syndromes and dementia, in addition to coronary heart disease and stroke.”(Fuchs and Whelton) This shows how those with high blood pressure are not only at risk for heart disease, but also more at risk for disease in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serum Cholesterol:** High serum cholesterol has been tested to be one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease and mortality caused by the disease. Therefore it is used as a predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sex:** We chose sex as one predictor as the sex and age combining affect the mortality of coronary artery disease. The mortality of women increases as aging, but the mortality of men is always higher than women.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Max heart rate:** We are using maximum heart rate as a predictor variable as seeing whether or not one can reach their maximum heart rate can predict coronary heart disease. Many studies have shown that those with coronary heart disease are unable to reach their age-specific maximum heart rate. Hence, those unable to reach their age predicted max heart rate are likely to be due to coronary heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will first be tidied/cleaned, and split into a training and testing. We will summarize and visualize some trends in the data so that it can be better understood and build context to what kind of data we are working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be trained on the training set and we will perform tuning and cross validation to find an optimal number of neighbors to ensure the best accuracy. Then, we will create a final model with the optimal neighbors and run the new model on the testing set. We will then collect the metrics and organize it in a table and a graph to see the performance and accuracy of the model in achieving the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "The performance of our model is surprising. The accuracy of our model is 72.37%. And the recall of our model is 71.42% with presence of heart disease as the positive variable (presence). Both of them are higher than expected. We were expecting an accuracy around 60% as we were limited by the number of quantitative variables to use as predictors in our dataset. The unexpected high accuracy and recall of our model indicates that there is a potential to use classification models in diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease. The models can be helpful to detect a general presence of coronary artery disease in potential patients, saving more time for the medical team and the patients. Also, by examining the result, we can see that the variables we have chosen are significant to detecting coronary artery disease and result in a better success rate than a 50/50 guess. Furthermore, they are relatively easy to measure with simple blood tests and heart check-ups. Therefore, doctors can test patients with resources that are easier to access to achieve a quicker diagnosis and aid to their decision making of if they are under risk of coronary artery disease, and can look for professional medical help immediately. In addition, from our predictions of testing data using k-nearest neighbors, we are curious about what other algorithms or variables could be used to achieve a higher accuracy than our k-nearest neighbors model on predicting the presence of heart disease. Variables such as average heart rate or if the patient is a smoker, are types of data that could be useful but were not present in our dataset. Since not all of the data in the dataset were included due to a lot of missing measurements and the levels of heart disease were ignored when we built the model, we could not see the complete effectiveness of classification algorithms on predicting heart disease. Overall, involving classification models in diagnosis of coronary artery disease is possible. \n"
